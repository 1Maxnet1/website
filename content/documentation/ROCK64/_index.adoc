The *ROCK64* is a credit-card size 4K60P HDR Media Board Computer powered by Rockchip RK3328 Quad-Core ARM Cortex A53 64-Bit Processor and supports up to 4GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 memory. It provides an eMMC module socket, MicroSD Card slot, Pi-2 Bus, Pi-P5+ Bus, USB 3.0, and many other peripheral interfaces for makers to integrate with sensors and other devices.

It supports many different open source operating systems, such as Android, Debian, and Yocto.

==== Power Draw

These numbers for power draw have been measured through an USB power monitor (FNB38) while running the `stress` utility, whereby "cpu" stands for `stress --cpu 4` and "vm" stands for `stress --vm 4`. The former spins on the CPU, the latter stresses the memory. Real workloads are usually a mix of both. The tests were ran through ssh, with nothing besides power and ethernet plugged into the ROCK64

Please keep in mind that under real world usage, many other factors come into play. Having a display connected, running a graphical session, I/O and most importantly the connected USB peripherals can add a lot.

Helpful refresher on the formula for power (W) on DC: power = current &times; voltage, because the power factor is 1. The ROCK64 runs on 5V, so use that to calculate current if you need to.

== Troubleshooting

=== HDMI output disconnects as soon as it connects

Some older monitors seemingly can get into a weird state wherein the ROCK64 is unable to establish a proper connection with them. User:CounterPillow has seen this happen on an iiyama ProLite G2773HS connected over HDMI, and an Acer P225HQL connected over an HDMI to DVI adapter. The symptoms usually are that you see the monitor briefly turn on its backlight without displaying a picture, but then immediately either shutting off again or showing a "No Signal" message.

The solution is to completely power down your ROCK64, also removing its power source. Then plug in the monitor, and start up the ROCK64 afterwards. You should now be getting a picture again.

=== Power button doesn't do anything on a short press (Linux)

Make sure the `rk805_pwrkey` module is loaded, e.g. with `lsmod | grep rk805_pwrkey`. If it doesn't show up, do a `modprobe rk805_pwrkey` as root. To make this persistent, create a `99-rk805_pwrkey.conf` in `/etc/modules-load.d/` with the content `rk805_pwrkey`

If it still doesn't work, make sure your init system is actually listening to the button press. With systemd, check `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` and make sure it's either all commented out (uses defaults) or contains something like `HandlePowerKey=poweroff`. You can change the short press action by setting `HandlePowerKey` to one of "ignore", "poweroff", "reboot", "halt", "kexec", "suspend", "hibernate", "hybrid-sleep", "suspend-then-hibernate", or "lock".

=== Video output is glitchy during activity

If your video output glitches out while there is memory bandwidth pressure, the likely reason is that the video output (VOP) quality-of-service (QoS) registers aren't set to high priority mode.

User:CounterPillow submitted https://overviewer.org/~pillow/up/c5179dcb67/0001-rockchip-rk3328-Set-VOP-QoS-to-high-priority.patch[a patch] to u-boot to fix this, but someone still needs to write a kernel patch to save/restore the QoS registers from the power domain driver.
