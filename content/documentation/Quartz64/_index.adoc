The *Quartz64* is the most recent Single Board Computer offering from PINE64, with Model A initially released in June of 2021 and Model B in May of 2022. It is powered by a Rockchip RK3566 Quad-Core ARM Cortex A55 64-Bit Processor with a MALI G-52 GPU.

Key features include a PCIe x4 open ended slot (model A) or m.2 (model B) using one Gen2 lane electrically, and the use of LPDDR4 RAM.

The Quartz64 has three LPDDR4 system memory options: 2GB, 4GB or 8GB. For booting, there is an eMMC module socket (supporting up to 128GB) and microSD slot, as well as a footprint to solder on an SPI flash chip. The board is equipped with HDMI, 1x USB 3.0 type A Host, 3x USB 2.0 Host, Gigabit Ethernet, SATA (model A), GPIO Bus, MiPi DSI interface, e-ink interface (model A), eDP interface (model A), touch Panel interface (model A), MiPi CSI interface, as well as many other device interfaces such as UART, SPI, I^2^C, for makers to integrate with sensors and other peripherals. Many different Operating Systems (OS) are freely available from the open source community, such as Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Arch), BSD, and Android.
