== Flashing the device


Natively the board only supports booting from the eMMC or microSD card, see link:#Boot_order[boot order]. There doesn't seem to be a way to boot from USB devices or SATA yet.

The board can be booted by flashing your favorite operating system to a microSD card using another device and to insert the microSD card into the Quartz64, see the article link:/documentation/General/Getting_started[Getting started]. Flashing the eMMC is possible by booting an operating system from the microSD card and to overwrite the eMMC from within the booted operating system.

== Boot order

The hardware boot order of the Quartz64 is:

. SPI NOR flash
. SPI NAND flash
. eMMC
. microSD card
