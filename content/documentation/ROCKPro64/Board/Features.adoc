On Linux, using the new `/dev/gpiochip` API, the `_n_` in `GPIO_n___XX_` appears to correlate to the number of the `/dev/gpiochip_n_`, and the `_XX_` to the definition `RK_P_XX_` of lines in `include/dt-bindings/pinctrl/rockchip.h` of the Linux kernel source. Having these named in the dts would be nice.

You can use https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libgpiod/libgpiod.git/[libgpiod] to drive them, and test them with the included tools (`gpioinfo`, `gpioset`, ...)

For example, `gpioset 4 25=1` (run as root) would turn pin 22 on. Do beware that poking the wrong GPIO pin can lock up your system.

The conversion table at right is also available as a https://gist.github.com/CounterPillow/fe066655bf2d929148fe6eb3f15b1dd5[C header file].

| PINE64 LCD Touchscreen (Screen/Touch)
| Yes/Yes
|
| No/No
|
|
| Maybe https://github.com/avafinger/pine64-touchscreen[this] will help get this working?

| Wireless
ROCKPro64 2×2 MIMO Dual Band WiFi 802.11AC / Bluetooth 4.2 Module (old)
ROCKPro64 1x1 Dual Band WiFi 802.11AC / Bluetooth 5.0 Module (new)
| Yes/Yes
|
| No/Yes*
|
| For the "new" ROCKPro64 WIFI module: Verified with Manjaro ARM (kernel 6.2.5). A config file ("firmware file") is needed at `/lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac43455-sdio.txt`. See here for the file contents and details: https://askubuntu.com/a/1211986.
| In 0.7.9 Ayufan linux releases this is deliberately disabled for stability reasons. After testing for a few hours, on Manjaro ARM (kernel 6.2.5), there haven't been stability issues found (WiFi stayed connected). On a 5GHz network (802.11AC), it was tested to be possible to get about 120Mbps using the "new" ROCKPro64 WIFI module.

|
|
|
| use this script: https://github.com/ayufan-rock64/linux-package/blob/master/root-rockpro64/usr/local/sbin/rockpro64_enable_otg.sh[rockpro64_enable_otg.sh], then configure ip on usb0: ifconfig usb0 169.169.222.222 and run iperf, you should likely see about 200-300MB/s

|
| Stopped working in 4.4.154.1105. Ayufan is looking into it. This is working in Manjaro ARM (kernel 6.2.5). Select the `Analog Output (Built-in Audio Stereo)` option in the audio output device selection window (either use `pavucontrol` or the volume button in the KDE desktop). Despite the slightly misleading name, audio does go through the HDMI port. See here for details: https://forum.manjaro.org/t/no-hdmi-audio-on-rockpro64/25595/2.

| Ventilation does not exist, thus requires manual changes to add venting. Case should be modified to account power adapter not being centered in cut holes. Opening the case once close without modifying it first is near impossible without special tools. Graphene heatsink is included and does well for Linux but not Android.
