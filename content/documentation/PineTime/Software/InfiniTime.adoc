== InfiniTime
InfiniTime (also known as JF's project, FreeRTOS firmware or Pinetime-JF) is an open source (GPLv3) firmware written in C++ and based on FreeRTOS, LVGL and NimBLE. This firmware (version 0.7.1) is preloaded at the factory since the new batch of PineTime devkits and sealed PineTimes of end of September 2020. *This page contains general information about the project. Actual project documentation and nuances are documented in the repository*

* GitHub repo: https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime
* Official website: https://infinitime.io/

== Read this first!

* InfiniTime and the bootloader are still in heavy development, and some features might not work as expected. Any issues should be reported on GitHub.
* Do not use a sealed PineTime as a development device, there is a fair amount of chances that you'll brick it with very experimental firmware.
* OTA is relatively stable, but when you're on an outdated bootloader version it can freeze which will require you to wait for the battery to run out.

== Known issues

WARNING: Please read this section carefully before upgrading the firmware on your PineTime, especially if you are using a sealed device!

=== Black screen after a reset in sleep mode

==== Description
This issue occurs if you are using the original bootloader (from InfiniTime 0.7.1), upgraded from InfiniTime 0.7.1 to 0.8.2 and the watch resets while the display is OFF: the watch is stuck on a black screen and does not respond to touch, button press or BLE.

The reset can be triggered by the watchdog or manually by long pressing the button. If that doesn't work, wait for the battery to run out, it'll reboot then.

This issue is caused by InfiniTime 0.8.2 that put the external SPI flash memory to sleep before switching the display off and by the bootloader that cannot wake the memory chip up. The bootloader is stuck in an infinite loop.

More info: https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/issues/24 and https://github.com/JF002/InfiniTime/issues/60

==== Workaround

On a development kit, a simple reset via SWD is needed to unlock the bootloader.

On a sealed device, the only way to work around this issue is to wait for the battery to drain completely before trying again.

This issue can be avoided by ensuring that the display is ON when manually resetting the device (long push on the button).

==== Fixed version

This issues is fixed in https://github.com/JF002/InfiniTime/releases/tag/0.8.3[InfiniTime 0.8.3]
