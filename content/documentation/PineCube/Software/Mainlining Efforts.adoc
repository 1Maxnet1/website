== Debugging

Camera issues can be debugged with the gstreamer pipeline. If the camera does not appear to work, it is possible to change the `v4l2src` to `videotestsrc` and the gstreamer pipeline will produce a synthetic test image without using the camera hardware.

If the camera is only sensor noise lines over a black or white image, the camera may be in a broken state. When in that state, the following kernel messages were observed:
