https://elimo.io[Elimo Engineering] integrated support for the PineCube into Buildroot.

This has not been merged into upstream Buildroot yet, but you can find the repository on https://github.com/elimo-engineering/buildroot[Elimo's GitHub account] and build instructions in the https://github.com/elimo-engineering/buildroot/tree/pine64/pinecube/board/pine64/pinecube[board support directory] readme.

The most important thing that this provides is support for the S3's DDR3 in u-boot. Unfortunately mainline u-boot does not have that yet, but the u-boot patches from https://github.com/danielfullmer/pinecube-nixos[Daniel Fullmer's NixOS repo] were easy enough to use on buildroot.

This should get you a functional system that boots to a console on UART0. It's pretty fast too, getting there in 1.5 seconds from u-boot to login prompt.
