{{SeeMainArticle|Quartz64 Development}}

Linux mainline is already quite far along for the device, as the SoC is the same as is used in the Quartz64 line of devices.

Notable features currently missing are the display panel driver (needs submitting), Wi-Fi driver (needs porting/major cleanup) and camera driver (needs writing).
