=== Known issues

* The display panel driver is in PineTab2's kernel fork, and needs to be submitted to upstream.
* The https://gitlab.com/TuxThePenguin0/bes2600[BES2600 Wi-Fi driver] needs major cleanup and bugfixing (at the moment it often causes system crashes). This is a priority, but for now, you can USB tether a phone or use a supported WI-FI dongle.
* The BES2600 Bluetooth driver needs to be implemented.
* The Camera drivers needs to be ported (https://github.com/rockchip-linux/kernel/blob/develop-4.19/drivers/media/i2c/gc02m2.c[gc02m2], https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/media/i2c/ov5648.c[ov5648]), Rockchip CSI/ISP driver needs to be extended to handle 2 lanes.
* Suspend does not currently work reliably due to a driver issue. It is therefore disabled in the factory image. Caveat Emptor if you chose to unmask the feature prior to it being fixed.
