This article is a list of convenient links to guides on soldering. Although it's not directly related to link:/documentation/Pinecil/_index[Pinecil] hardware, many PINE64 members ask for this kind of information in daily live chat. If you don't find something here, then try an Internet search as this is just a starting point for convenience.

== What temperature should I use?

1. General Formula: `add 120°C to the melting point` listed on the solder label, and adjust up/down as needed for different tasks.
* Example: the solder says 220°C melt point, then `220 + 120 = 340 °C`
* One could also try these common working temperatures below, start lower and increment by 5°C until you get a comfortable working temperature (thicker wires & situations dictate more or less).

 Common working temperatures if direct data for the solder can not be found:
 # For Lead solder: 300°C - 320°C
 # For No-lead solder: 350°C - 365°C

2. Another method is an Internet search to find a chart like below for your specific type of solder alloy:
* https://www.kester.com/Portals/0/Documents/Knowledge%20Base/Alloy%20Temperature%20Chart.pdf[Alloy Temperature Chart - Kester]

3. Adding a small amount of solder to your tip before starting increases the thermal mass of the tip and could help instead of cranking the temperature super high (which causes other problems). See the link:#general_soldering_guides[soldering guides] above for demonstrations of this in several articles and videos.

== Using the Conical tip

*How do I use the conical tip that comes default with Pinecil to get enough heat transfer?*

. Use the *side* of the tip to heat the pin. Do not hold it vertically like a pen because the very end of the tip has little heat mass. See https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/4/SolderingAdvice_1edit.png
. Correct amount of solder and solder flow. See https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/4/SolderingAdvice_2.png
