The article contains information about cases, holders/stands, 3D-models, and supplies for the link:/documentation/Pinecil[Pinecil] soldering iron. This is a small set of examples based on the many questions asked every week in the live Pinecil chat channel. There may be better althernatives depending on your part of the world, but this gives an idea of some possible options.

== Cases and bags

* https://a.co/d/hjFRpzK[EVA Shockproof Case]
* https://a.co/d/i6QoxKl[Aluminum hard case w/foam] (check size before ordering if multiple listed).
* https://a.co/d/gAYy8fG[Aluminum poker case w/foam]
* Soft Bag https://a.co/d/48PjOwZ[Molle IFAK/EDC]: look for bags that can fully open like a sandwich when unzipped which allows tools to be easily seen and retrieved. Bags that only partially unzip make it harder to find tools without dumping out the whole bag.

== Holders and stands
