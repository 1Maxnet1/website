== Introduction and Instructions

This Wiki section offers a variety of projects for PINE64 devices. It is co-created and driven by users like yourself, so feel free to browse the listed projects or even submit your own. If you are interested in contributing a project then *please first read* though the following two sub-sections (on Contributing New Projects and Authorship) before entering your submission.

*All submissions are welcome. You can submit hardware-based projects, software-based projects or a mix of the two*. For example, you could build an NAS server enclosure for your PINE64 SBC and then create a software-based tutorial on how to take advantage of the setup you built.

If you feel that a particular theme or project type is not represented on the Wiki then please create a post about it in the relevant section on the https://forum.pine64.org/[PINE64 forum].

=== Contributing New Projects

There are a number of ways in which you can contribute new projects to this Wiki section. Projects can be submitted by:

* Adding a link to a post on the forum, blog, git instructions, etc.,
* Adding a link to an article (please read about authorship in 1.2)
* Adding a link to a video or audio file with project instructions
* Adding links to documents (e.g. Google docs, PDFs, etc,.) of images hosted on Google Drive, Imgur, etc,.
* A combination of two or more of the above

The preferable way of submitting a new project is by *creating a new Wiki entry* as this assures that it will be *easy to locate* by other users. Wiki entries can include attachments in the form of photos, videos, documents and external links (e.g. to formatted code); making them ideal for storing complex and lengthy tutorials and instructions.

That said, if you do not wish to migrate your project tutorial from another place (e.g. the forums) then a link to the complete write-up, code, video or another medium will suffice.

=== Authorship

If you are the author of the submitted project, be sure to credit yourself accordingly. You are also welcome to remain anonymous if you prefer.
However, if you are linking or referencing an external project or source code that has been written up/ recorded/ created *by someone else* then you *must credit the person or organisation* that the project and/or related resources belong to.
