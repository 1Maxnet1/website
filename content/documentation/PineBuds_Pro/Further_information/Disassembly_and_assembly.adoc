Disassembling the charging case:

. First open the lid and then try to press the case from the front edge with a plectrum or a thin card. There are two clips on each side. Soon the case will snap open.
. Carefully unscrew and remove the PCB from the case.

Assembling the charging case:

. Screw the PCB back into the place.
. There is plenty of space, glue the coil to the bottom of the case.
. Close the charging case.
