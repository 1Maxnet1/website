For instructions on how to install the operating systems to the eMMC or microSD card see link:/documentation/PinePhone/Installation_instructions[Installation instructions]. The information is almost the same for the PineTab, as it is a very similar device. Do not try to use the PinePhone images though, use the PineTab images linked above.

For details see the link:/documentation/General/Getting_started[Getting started] article.
