The PineTab will automatically boot from microSD if a bootable card is inserted. Although it is technically possible to use any ARM distro (because the PineTab uses the mainline kernel), only few of them will actually be usable on Early Adopters PineTab, due to specifics of working with LCD panel. Among those listed all except for postmarketOS have working builds.

* encrypt your installation
* install from the SD card to eMMC

Many things are still broken but Bluetooth, Audio, Rotation and Keyboard are working.

== UBPorts

image:/documentation/images/Ubports-logo.png[]

The *UBPorts Ubuntu Touch* is what was preinstalled on the PineTab Early Adopters batch.

It can update itself in System Settings, and also a jenkins daily build can be downloaded at this updated address for the latest daily image:

https://ci.ubports.com/job/rootfs/job/rootfs-pinetab-systemimage/

The last stable builds are also listed and appear to be updated every few weeks.

It should be noted that as of 20th January the latest stable/release candidate and development builds  still lacked Bluetooth, Rotation and had the same issues with online accounts etc

Online accounts access have a fix for Google accounts here https://github.com/rubencarneiro/account-plugins/releases

There are however significant updates to the original PineTab image (without the issues above)

The old image appears to be deprecated here

In the event that WiFi fails to connect, the USB port can be used with an appropriate dongle to connect for internet using ethernet cable.
