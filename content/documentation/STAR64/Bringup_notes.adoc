NOTE: This section to be refined/replaced as boards and tools mature.

. The https://files.pine64.org/doc/star64/Star64_Schematic_V1.0_20220721.pdf[schematic] has several discrepancies with actual board labels.
. The serial console can be found with TXD on pin 8 and RXD on pin 10; a convention common to Pi-style boards. Use the 40pin header pinouts in color on page one and not the schematic prose.
. If you have only a single core running and no PCI card present, it appears to power up via the +5V/GND lines from the USB serial adapter pins.
. It will not boot from a VisionFive R1 uSD card.
. The boot device switch labels and the silk screen are inverted. "0" means "On".
. 2021.10-00001-gdbdaad919b will attempt to boot from SPI, but it appears blank. If you let it for many minutes, the device will eventually time out and boot OpenSBI v1.0  from (SPI?). This will fail, but only after self-identifying as a VisionFive R2, complete with five cores and 4 GB of RAM, before failing. A "press any key" timeout is offered, but I've been unable to make it stop. It will eventually crash with:

 Loading Environment from SPIFlash... SF: Detected gd25lq128 with page size 256 Bytes, erase size 4 KiB, total 16 MiB
 *** Warning - bad CRC, using default environment

 Not a StarFive EEPROM data format - magic error
