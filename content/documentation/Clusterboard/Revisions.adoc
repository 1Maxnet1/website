As of April 2021, current revision of the Clusterboard is 2.3; compared with the previous revision, 2.2, it removes the PCB components required for using lithium-polymer batteries for powering each of the modules.  Besides the 2.2 revision, there was also an early revision (TO-DO: which exactly?) that required a hardware fix for the eMMC module to work properly.
