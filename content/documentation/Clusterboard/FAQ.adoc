*Q*: Are the individual MAC addresses linked to the PHY chips, or the module?

*A*: The MAC address is specific to the SOPINE module; swapping modules within the Clusterboard does not change the MAC address of the module.

*Q*: Why will SOPINE modules not reboot when installed on a Clusterboard, but will when installed on a link:/documentation/SOPINE_Baseboard/_index[SOPINE Baseboard]?

*A*: The cause has been determined to be back-EMF, and can be resolved with some relatively easy hardware modifications, thanks to excellent troubleshooting performed by Eric. Please, have a look at the https://ericdraken.com/a64-reset-problem/[extensive article] he wrote to find out how to resolve this issue.  See also https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=5849&page=2[this forum thread] for further information.

*Q*: Do I need heatsinks on any of the components on the Clusterboard?

*A*: According to the datasheets for the RTL8370N switch ASIC and the RTL8211E PHYs, they consume and thus dissipate up to about 3&nbsp;W each.  As a result, it would be advisable to properly affix passive aluminum heatsinks onto each of these components.  Please note that this explanation does not cover the SOPINE and SOEDGE modules.
