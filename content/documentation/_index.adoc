== Community and Support

Community collaboration and support is focused around the chat platforms and forums described below. See https://www.pine64.org/gettings-started/[Getting Started | PINE64] for tips about how to get started with the PINE64 community.

=== Chat Platforms

PINE64 has a large and very active community. Community discussion takes place on a variety of chat platforms, which are all bridged together so the messages sent via one platform are sent to all other platforms automatically. The other networks and their users are represented by P64ProtocolBot.

NOTE: PINE64 community is not some always responding, restless commercial customer service, or some sort of almighty existence that can resolve all your problems. When participating in community discussions, please be patient and do not expect questions to be answered immediately, certainly, or currently.

* The activity of community members varies depending on the time of day and the number of active users.
* Whether your questions will be answered & whether the answers are right and definitive, depends on the information you provide, and, after all, difficulty of your questions & community members' ability.
* Read http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html[How To Ask Questions The Smart Way] to learn more.
* Please read link:General/Rules[].
* PINE64 uses a bridge bot (_https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge[matterbridge]_ with some modifications), which allows Discord, IRC, Matrix, and Telegram users to see and participate in the community chat.
* The bot name is "Pine64 Protocol Droid" and if you see this, look in the message to see the actual author of the message.
* When the bot relays messages it will show the platform the user is using: _[D]_ for _Discord_, _[I]_ for _IRC_, _[M]_ for _Matrix_ and _[T]_ for _Telegram_.

The community chat platforms are the following:

* *Discord*: use this *https://discord.gg/pine64[Invite Link]*. All Pine64 discord channels are immediately viewable, do not need to join separate channels like the Telegram/Matrix table below.
* *IRC*: the server is _irc.pine64.org_. Use `/list` command or the table below to see the full list of channels.
* *Matrix and Telegram*: See the table below.
