The *Pinebook Pro* is a Linux and *BSD ARM laptop from PINE64. It is built to be a compelling alternative to mid-ranged Chromebooks that people convert into Linux laptops.

It features an IPS 1080p 14â€³ LCD panel, a premium magnesium alloy shell, high capacity eMMC storage, a 10,000 mAh capacity battery, and the modularity that only an open source project can deliver with the dimensions of 329mm x 220mm x 12mm (WxDxH). Key features include the RK3399 SOC, USB-C for data, video-out and power-in (3A 5V), privacy switches for the microphone, BT/WiFi module, camera and expandable storage via NVMe (PCIe x4) with an optional adapter. The Pinebook Pro is equipped with 4GB LPDDR4 system memory, high capacity eMMC flash storage, and 128Mb SPI boot Flash. The I/O includes: 1 x micro SD card reader (bootable), 1 x USB 2.0, 1 x USB 3.0, 1 x USB type C Host with DP 1.2 and power-in, PCIe x4 for an NVMe SSD drive (requires an optional adapter), and UART (via the headphone jack by setting an internal switch). The keyboard and touchpad both use the USB 2.0 protocol. The LCD panel uses eDP MiPi display protocol.
