This page explains how to flash an Ox64 board and a microSD card to boot the system. You will need a Linux machine, a serial UART adapter, the Ox64 board, a microSD card and the flashing files: the prebuilt images from openbouffalo or the built ones from link:/documentation/Ox64/Software/Building/[Building] section.

== Preparing serial UART adapter Raspberry Pi Pico

First, download the Raspberry Pi Pico firmware that allows it to act as a serial UART adapter. 

 mkdir -p ~/ox64/pico
 cd ~/ox64/pico
 wget https://github.com/Kris-Sekula/Pine64_Ox64_SBC/raw/main/uart/picoprobe.uf2

Put the Raspberry Pi Pico board into programming mode.

* Press the BootSel button
* Apply power by plugging the USB cable to PC
* Release the BootSel button

NOTE: As an alternative to pressing the BootSel button, you can also connect the probe point `TP6` (located on the bottom of the Pico board) to any ground point (e.g. pin 28).

Copy `picoprobe.uf2` file into the new device `/media/<user>/RPI-RP2`.

 cp ~/ox64/pico/picoprobe.uf2 /media/<user>/RPI-RP2

Next, connect the Ox64 board to the Pico according to the following wiring diagram:

 OX64                      PI PICO         /dev/tty
 uart0_Tx_GPIO14_pin1 <->  uart0_Rx_pin17  ACM1 for flashing
 uart0_Rx_GPIO15_pin2 <->  uart0_Tx_pin16  ACM1 for flashing
 Rxd_GPIO17_pin31     <->  uart1_Tx_pin6   ACM0 for serial console
 Txd_GPIO16_pin32     <->  uart1_Rx_pin7   ACM0 for serial console
 gnd_pin38            <->  gnd_pin38/3     
 vbus5v_pin40         <->  vbus5v_pin40     

With the Pico flashed and wired as per the instructions above, we have access to two of the Ox64's UART connections at the same time. This configuration eliminates the need to switch the physical connections for flashing or testing the system.

 ls /dev/ttyACM*

Espected result:

* `/dev/ttyACM0` connects to the D0 core's (i.e. Linux's) serial console
* `/dev/ttyACM1` is used for flashing (but also connects to the M0 core's serial console)

=== Optional: preparing serial UART adapter Stm32f103c8t6

To program Stm32f103c8t6, knows as Bluepill, you'll need a TTL serial adpter like FTDI Ft232rl board.

Download `Bluepill Serial Monster` firmware from r2axz's github repository that allows it to act as a serial UART adapter. More infos on https://github.com/r2axz/bluepill-serial-monster

 cd ~/ox64
 mkdir -p stm32f103c8t6
 cd ~/ox64/stm32f103c8t6
 wget https://github.com/r2axz/bluepill-serial-monster/releases/download/v2.6.4/bluepill-serial-monster.hex
 sudo apt install stm32flash

Put the Stm32f103c8t6 board into programming mode:

 * Set boot jumpers for booting from rom: Boot0=1, Boot1=0.
 * Connect it to a USB-Serial adapter (i.e Ft232rl) with A9 to Rx, A10 to Tx, GND to GND, 3v3 to Vcc.
 * Apply power by plugging the USB cable to PC. Press the Reset button.

Check the USB-serial adapter (i.e Ft232rl) to be expected on /dev/ttyUSB0

 ls /dev/ttyUSB0

Upload the firmware:

 cd ~/ox64/stm32f103c8t6
 stm32flash -w  bluepill-serial-monster.hex /dev/ttyUSB0
 
After upload, set boot jumpers for boot from flash: Boot0=0, Boot1=0.
Remove USB-serial adapter

Re-connect Stm32f103c8t6 to usb.

After flashing, verify that you have two serial interfaces (when the STM32f103c8t6 is connected to your PC):

 ls /dev/ttyACM*

Expected result:
 /dev/ttyACM0
 /dev/ttyACM1
 /dev/ttyACM2

Next, connect the Ox64 board to the Stm32f103c8t6 according to the following wiring diagram:

 OX64                      STM32         /dev/tty
 uart0_Tx_GPIO14_pin1 <->  uart0_Rx_A3   ACM1 for flashing
 uart0_Rx_GPIO15_pin2 <->  uart0_Tx_A2   ACM1 for flashing
 Rxd_GPIO17_pin31     <->  uart1_Tx_A9   ACM0 for serial console
 Txd_GPIO16_pin32     <->  uart1_Rx_A10  ACM0 for serial console
 gnd_pin38            <->  GND
 vbus5v_pin40         <->  5V

=== Optional: preparing a serial adapter other than the Raspberry Pi Pico or Stm32f103c8t6

If you are using one of the link:/documentation/Ox64/Further_information/Compatible_UARTs/[supported UART adapters] that isn't the Raspberry Pi Pico, you will only have one serial interface available to you. For the purposes of this guide, let's say it is `/dev/ttyUSB0`. In addition, you will need a way of powering your Ox64. If your serial adapter has a 5V line, you can connect it to VBUS (pin 40). Otherwise, you can connect either the micro-B or the USB-C port on the Ox64 to any 5V power supply.

Refer to the pinout image below. Connect your UART adapter as follows:

* RX -> UART0_TX / GPIO14 / pin 1
* TX -> UART0_RX / GPIO15 / pin 2
* GND -> any ground (e.g. pin 3)

Then, follow the instructions in <<flashing_the_ox64>> and <<flashing_the_microsd_card>>, but replace all occurrences of `/dev/ttyACM1` with `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

Next, power off the Ox64 and re-connect your UART adapter as follows:

* RX -> TXD / GPIO16 / pin 32
* TX -> RXD / GPIO17 / pin 31
* GND -> any ground (e.g. pin 33)

Then, follow the instructions in <<booting_for_the_first_time>>, but replace all occurrences of `/dev/ttyACM0` with `/dev/ttyUSB0`. You should now have a working Linux system.

== Optional: downloading flashing files

Download the Ox64 images from the latest OpenBouffalo release. You may skip this step if you built your own images as per the instructions in the link:/documentation/Ox64/Software/Building/[Building] section.

 mkdir -p ~/ox64/openbouffalo
 cd ~/ox64/openbouffalo
 wget https://github.com/openbouffalo/buildroot_bouffalo/releases/download/v1.0.1/bl808-linux-pine64_ox64_full_defconfig.tar.gz
 tar -xvzf bl808-linux-pine64_ox64_full_defconfig.tar.gz
 cd ~/ox64/openbouffalo/firmware
 xz -v -d -k sdcard-pine64_ox64_full_defconfig.img.xz
 mv sdcard-pine64_ox64_full_defconfig.img sdcard.img

=== Optional: create a combined SoC image

Use the following commands to combine `m0_lowload_bl808_m0.bin`, `d0_lowload_bl808_d0.bin`, and `bl808-firmware.bin` into a single image. This is mainly useful for troubleshooting (e. g. when using DevCube v1.8.4 or later).

 cd ~/ox64/openbouffalo/firmware

 fallocate -l 0x800000 bl808-combined.bin
 dd conv=notrunc if=m0_lowload_bl808_m0.bin of=bl808-combined.bin
 dd conv=notrunc if=d0_lowload_bl808_d0.bin of=bl808-combined.bin seek=$((0x100000))B
 cat bl808-firmware.bin >> bl808-combined.bin

Check that you have the required files for flashing

 cd ~/ox64/openbouffalo/firmware
 ls *808*.bin *.img

Expected files:

* `sdcard.img` -- Kernel and root filesystem. Runs on the D0 core.
* `m0_lowload_bl808_m0.bin` -- Startup code for the M0 core.
* `d0_lowload_bl808_d0.bin` -- Startup code for the D0 core.
* `bl808-firmware.bin` -- OpenSBI and UBoot DTB files. Runs on the D0 core.
* `bl808-combined.bin` -- optional

== Preparing flashing tools

BouffaloLab provides open-source CLI flashing packages `bflb-iot-tool` and `bflb-mcu-tool` or the DevCube flashing software.

=== CLI packages installation

Install `bflb-iot-tool` using your preferred method of managing PIP packages. One option is to set up a Python virtual environment as follows.

 sudo apt install python3-venv
 python3 -m venv ~/ox64_venv
 . ~/ox64_venv/bin/activate # remember to re-run command for each new terminal window
 pip install bflb-iot-tool # we are *not* using bflb-mcu-tool

==== Optional: DevCube installation

Download the latest DevCube flashing tool from BouffaloLab's website.

 mkdir -p ~/ox64/devcube
 cd ~/ox64/devcube
 wget https://dev.bouffalolab.com/media/upload/download/BouffaloLabDevCube-v1.8.9.zip
 unzip BouffaloLabDevCube-v1.8.9.zip
 chmod u+x BLDevCube-ubuntu

If you are not creating a <<optional_create_a_combined_soc_image, combined image>> you may need an older version of the DevCube. In that case, download v1.8.3 from one of the mirrors below:

* https://openbouffalo.org/static-assets/bldevcube/BouffaloLabDevCube-v1.8.3.zip
* https://hachyderm.io/@mkroman/110787218805897192[] > https://pub.rwx.im/~mk/bouffalolab/BouffaloLabDevCube-v1.8.3.zip
* https://we.tl/t-eJWShQJ4iF
* https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771032441971802142/1145565853962735639/BouffaloLabDevCube-v1.8.3.zip

Verify that your copy of `BouffaloLabDevCube-v1.8.3.zip` matches the hashes below:

* SHA1: `0f2619e87d946f936f63ae97b0efd674357b1166`
* SHA256: `e6e6db316359da40d29971a1889d41c9e97d5b1ff1a8636e9e6960b6ff960913`

== Flashing the Ox64

Put the Ox64 into programming mode:

* Press the BOOT button
* Apply power or re-plug the USB cable
* Release the BOOT button

=== CLI flashing method

Set up some environment variables to save typing them out later:

 PORT=/dev/ttyACM1 # or /dev/ttyUSB0, this will depend on which serial adapter you use
 BAUD=230400       # safe value for macOS, if using Linux set to 2000000 for faster flashing
 . ~/ox64_venv/bin/activate # make sure the virtual environment is active

Change directory to the location of your image files:

 cd ~/ox64/openbouffalo/firmware # for github's downloaded prebuilt images
 or
 cd ~/ox64/buildroot/output/images # for built images

Finally, flash the Ox64. If you created a **combined image** then run the following command:

 bflb-iot-tool --chipname bl808 --interface uart --port $PORT --baudrate $BAUD --addr 0x0 --firmware bl808-combined.bin  --single

Otherwise:

 bflb-iot-tool --chipname bl808 --interface uart --port $PORT --baudrate $BAUD --addr 0x0 --firmware m0_lowload_bl808_m0.bin --single
 bflb-iot-tool --chipname bl808 --interface uart --port $PORT --baudrate $BAUD --addr 0x100000 --firmware d0_lowload_bl808_d0.bin --single
 bflb-iot-tool --chipname bl808 --interface uart --port $PORT --baudrate $BAUD --addr 0x800000 --firmware bl808-firmware.bin --single

If you get permission errors when running any of the commands above, you may need to add your user to the `dialout` group. Running the commands as `root` is not recommended since this will make `bflb-iot-tool` create root-owned files in your home directory.

==== Optional: BLDevCube flashing method

Open a new terminal window to run the DevCube flasher.

 cd ~/ox64/devcube
 ./BLDevCube-ubuntu

Select chip [BL808], press Finish, and configure BOTH the [MCU] and [IOT] tabs as follows. When you switch between tabs double check that they still match the settings below.

 Interface: UART
 Port/SN: /dev/ttyACM1 or /dev/ttyUSB0 (make sure you don't use /dev/ttyACM0, it's used by the minicom console)
 Uart rate 230400 (safe value for macOS, if using Linux set to 2000000 for faster flashing)

If you created a **combined image** then you only need to use the [IOT] tab:

 Enable 'Single Download'
 Image Address [0x0], [PATH to bl808-combined.bin]
 Click 'Create & Download' and wait until it's done
 Close DevCube

Otherwise, start in the [MCU] tab:

 M0 Group[group0], Image Address [0x58000000], [PATH to m0_lowload_bl808_m0.bin]
 D0 Group[group0], Image Address [0x58100000], [PATH to d0_lowload_bl808_d0.bin]
 Click 'Create & Download' and wait until it's done

Then, switch to the [IOT] tab and set:

 Enable 'Single Download'
 Image Address [0x800000], [PATH to bl808-firmware.bin]
 Click 'Create & Download' again and wait until it's done
 Close DevCube

== Flashing the microSD card

Insert the microSD card into your PC, locate its device file (`/dev/sdb`, for example), and write the image:

 cd ~/ox64/openbouffalo/firmware # for github's downloaded prebuilt images
 or
 cd ~/ox64/buildroot/output/images # for built images
 sudo dd if=sdcard.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1M status=progress conv=fsync

== Booting for the first time

Insert the microSD card into your Ox64 and open a UART connection to the Ox64 board. As mentioned, Raspberry Pi Pico allow two UART console at the same time, without swithcing connection to D0 and M0 core.  

Open a terminal window to connects to the D0 core’s (i.e. Linux’s) serial console:

 minicom -b 2000000 -D /dev/ttyACM0

Open an other terminal window to connects to the M0 core’s serial console (`/dev/ttyACM1` is also used for flashing)

 minicom -b 2000000 -D /dev/ttyACM1

Re-apply power to the Ox64.

On `ttyACM0` console you will see Linux booting up. When prompted, log in as `root` with no password. In case card is missing or empty, you'll get `Card did not respond to voltage select! : -110` error.

On `ttACM1` console you'll see following log, until the sytem in not fully loaded:

 [I][MBOX] Mailbox IRQ Stats:
 [I][MBOX] Peripheral SDH (33): 0
 [I][MBOX] Peripheral GPIO (60): 0
 [I][MBOX] Unhandled Interupts: 0 Unhandled Signals 0

Once the system is running you'll be able to manage the M0 multimedia core, i.e. wifi settings, etc.. When prompted, digit `help` to see available commands.

=== Connecting Ox64 to your router AP
Since the Ox64 wifi scan doesn't always work properly, run the connection command from D0/Linux on /dev/ttyACM0 serial console:

 blctl connect_ap YourAP YourPassword

Wait for it to connect (if you're already watching the M0 on /dev/ttyACM1 serial console it should tell you there), then run command still from /dev/ttyACM0 serial console:

 udhcpc -i bleth0
 
Move your Ox64 right next to your router; the chip antenna on the board isn't very good.

=== Appendix: adding Nuttx RTOS

In this section, we will set up our Ox64 to dual-boot both Linux and the NuttX real-time operating system. For more information see the https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/platforms/risc-v/bl808/boards/ox64/index.html[official documentation].

First, write the normal Linux image to the SD card if you have not done so already. For the purposes of this guide we will assume the SD card's device file is `/dev/sdb`.

 cd ~/ox64/openbouffalo/firmware # for github's downloaded prebuilt images
 or
 cd ~/ox64/buildroot/output/images # for built images
 sudo dd if=/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1M conv=fsync status=progress

Run the following command to re-read the partition tables. Re-inserting the SD card works too.

 sudo blockdev --rereadpt /dev/sdb

Download the NuttX image:

 mkdir -p ~/ox64/nuttx
 cd ~/ox64/nuttx
 wget -O ImageNuttx https://github.com/lupyuen2/wip-pinephone-nuttx/releases/download/bl808d-1/Image

Mount the boot partition and make the required modifications:

 sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt
 sudo cp ImageNuttx /mnt/

 cat <<EOF | sudo tee -a /mnt/extlinux/extlinux.conf
 LABEL Pine64 0X64 Nuttx
        KERNEL ../ImageNuttx
        FDT ../bl808-pine64-ox64.dtb
        APPEND root=PARTLABEL=rootfs rootwait rw rootfstype=ext4 console=ttyS0,2000000 loglevel=8 earlycon=sbi
 EOF

 sudo umount /mnt

Mount the rootfs and make the required modifications:

 sudo mount /dev/sdb3 /mnt
 sudo cp ImageNuttx /mnt/boot/

 cat <<EOF | sudo tee -a /mnt/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf
 LABEL Pine64 0X64 Nuttx
        KERNEL ../ImageNuttx
        FDT ../bl808-pine64-ox64.dtb
        APPEND root=PARTLABEL=rootfs rootwait rw rootfstype=ext4 console=ttyS0,2000000 loglevel=8 earlycon=sbi
 EOF

 sudo umount /mnt

Enjoy your new Nuttx booting option!
